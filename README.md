Chrome extension to block AI Mode features in chrome.
Removes the AI Overview div block after a search.
You can also chooose to search in 'web-only' mode, which filters everything but links to websites. Or, ' -ai' mode, which appends -ai to the end of your search, which also disables the ai mode (the search results also slightly change however).
